# Professor Nelson's Knowledge Supplements

This is a small collection of tools (widgets so far) that queries APIs for relevant supplemental materials. 
So far, Court Listener and the Digital Library of America are supported.

You need API keys/tokens for both.

Results are currently throttled and cached. (Details of that will be changeable later.)

## CourtListener
API information (and key/token) is available at:
https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/

## Digital Public Library of America
API information (and key/token) is available at:
https://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/#get-a-key

## More
Additional APIs, better documentation, and other improvements may come around soonish. For now, it works.
