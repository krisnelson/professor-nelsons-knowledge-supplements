# Professor Nelson's Knowledge Supplements

This is a small collection of tools (widgets so far) that queries APIs for relevant supplemental materials. 
So far, Court Listener and the Digital Library of America are supported.

You need API keys/tokens for both.

Results are currently throttled and cached. (Details of that will be changeable later.)

## Why the name?
Well, I teach university students about
the history of science, so there's that. Second, it's a 
(minimally) amusing reference to old-fashioned patent remedies. Hey, it makes
me smile, so whatevs, right?

## CourtListener
API information (and key/token) is available at:
https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/

## Digital Public Library of America
API information (and key/token) is available at:
https://dp.la/info/developers/codex/policies/#get-a-key

## More
Additional APIs, better documentation, and other improvements may come around soonish. For now, it works.
